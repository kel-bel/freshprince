		<h1><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare">The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</a></h1>

			<img src="fresh_prince_image.jpg" alt="Cannot_find">

			<p>From western Philadelphia I hail
			where in my youth I'd play upon the green
			'til - rue the day! -I found myself assail'd
			by ruffians contemptible and mean.	
			Athough the spat was trivial and brief,
			it wounded my dear mother deep within;
			and so, to give her conscience sweet relief,
			she sent me forth to live amongst her kin.
			When to my port of call I'd been conveyed,
			and yet, I simply took the trip and paid,
			despite his cab's decor and fresh mystique.
			I survey all the land with princely mien
			in fair Bel-Air, where I do lay my scene.</p>
